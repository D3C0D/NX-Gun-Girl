# NX Gun-Girl
This is an arcade infinite minigame shooter made specifically to test a homebrew deployment to the Nintendo Switch.

# How to use
You can find binary files originally publicized on the official [Itch page of NX Gun-Girl](https://amenohi.itch.io/nx-gun-girl)

Just download the Zip file, place it on the /Switch directory of your SD card and launch with the homebrew menu.

Alternatively, there is a browser version available to play on the page too :P
